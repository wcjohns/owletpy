This directory is based upon [owletpy](https://github.com/CAB426/owletpy/tree/ef143051d236eba56faebac1055fd56191ea2e63) by CAB426.
owletpy/OwletPy.py was slightly modified and example.py was turned into get_data.py that writes information out into a sqlite3 database and CSV files when there is new updated data.
